<p class=".funnybone">Our prototype is an app that helps people learn and treat HIV. The app includes features like learning new stats about HIV and other peoples stories, making and booking appoinments at local clincts, and even treatment features. The app is free and is made for victims from all parts of the world. People from all ages can use our app, it is completly free. The only requirments is to have email. We took in consideration all the feedback we have collected, we modified our prototype so it can be it's best version (so far) based on user feedback.We made this app victims could have more access to the resources they need in order to treat their HIV. Many have HIV and cannot reach the point to where they can treat it, it is harder for them to schedule appoinments, this app can help close the space that is between the victims and resources.</p>
